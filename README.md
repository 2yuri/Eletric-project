# Eletric project

### 💻 This was my first project.

It's basically a resistor calculator 🤙🏻

## Input:

- You have to select what is  your situation (parallel, in series, mist)
- You have to input tension value
- You have to input resistor values

## Output

- Alert with all values Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law
